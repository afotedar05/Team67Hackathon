        <h2>About Our Team</h2>
        <p>
          From the early dawn of November 8, 2025 to the blistering cold midday of November 9, 2025, Team 67 embarked on an epic Datathon journey. Taking on the HEB challenge proved to be difficult at first, but with our powerful team name and four brilliant minds hard at work, it should have been clear from the very beginning that our team was destined for success. We have created a fantastic interface that allows users to build tensors in real time, and save them for quick querying and infinite use. In the end, we believe we have developed a groundbreaking product for <b>THE 67 VIPs</b> around the world.
